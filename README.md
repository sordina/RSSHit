# [RSSHit](http://rsshit.com) - Really Simple Shit

Why complicate RSS?

Too many online RSS solutions couple feed aggregation with feed reading. RSSHit only deals with aggregation.

## How it works

Users can:

* Sign up
* Sign out
* Delete their account
* Sign in...

* Add a feed
* Remove a feed

* Add a global or per-feed filter
* Remove a filter

Feed items are merged into the meta-feed verbatim.

* Haskell
* Fay
* Angular
* Flat-UI
* Postgres
